# Deduper

## Part 1
Use this repo template to create your own Deduper repo - you should do all your work in your own repository. Please name it `Deduper-<github-user-name>`.

Write up a strategy for writing a Reference Based PCR Duplicate Removal tool. That is, given a sorted sam file of uniquely mapped reads, remove all PCR duplicates (retain only a single copy of each read). Develop a strategy that avoids loading everything into memory. You should not write any code for this portion of the assignment. Be sure to:
- Define the problem
- Write examples:
    - Include a properly formated sorted input sam file
    - Include a properly formated expected output sam file
- Develop your algorithm using pseudocode
- Determine high level functions
    - Description
    - Function headers
    - Test examples (for individual functions)
    - Return statement
    
For this portion of the assignment, you should design your algorithm for single-end data, with 96 UMIs. UMI information will be in the QNAME, like so: ```NS500451:154:HWKTMBGXX:1:11101:15364:1139:GAACAGGT```. Discard any UMIs with errors (or error correct, if you're feeling ambitious).

## Part 2
An important part of writing code is reviewing code - both your own and other's. In this portion of the assignment, you will be assigned 3 students' algorithms to review. Be sure to evaluate the following points:
- Does the proposed algorithm make sense to you? Can you follow the logic?
- Does the algorithm do everything it's supposed to do? (see part 1)
- Are proposed functions reasonable? Are they "standalone" pieces of code?

You can find your assigned reviewees on Canvas. You can find your fellow students' repositories at 
```

Be sure to leave comments on their repositories by creating issues or by commenting on the pull request.

## Part 3
Write your deduper function!

Given a SAM file of uniquely mapped reads, remove all PCR duplicates (retain only a single copy of each read). Remember:
- Your Python code can assume a sorted sam file (you *might* need to use `samtools sort` outside of your Python script)
- Account for: 
    - all possible CIGAR strings (including adjusting for soft clipping, etc.)
    - Strand
    - Single-end reads
    - Known UMIs
- Considerations:
    - Millions of reads â€“ avoid loading everything into memory!
    - Be sure to utilize functions appropriately
    - Appropriately comment code and include doc strings
- **CHALLENGE**: In a **separate branch**, implement options for
    - Single-end vs paired-end
    - Known UMIs vs randomers
    - Choice of duplicate written to file
    
You MUST:
- Write Python 3.10 compatible code
- Include the following argparse options
    - ```-f```, ```--file```: designates absolute file path to sorted sam file
    - ```-o```, ```--outfile```: designates absolute file path to sorted sam file
    - ```-u```, ```--umi```: designates file containing the list of UMIs
    - ```-h```, ```--help```: prints a USEFUL help message (see argparse docs)
        - That is, your code must be able to run (in a single step) if given a command in the format:
          ```
          ./<your_last_name>_deduper.py -u STL96.txt -f <in.sam> -o <out.sam>
          ```
- Output the first read encountered if duplicates are found
- Output a properly formatted SAM file
- Name your python script ```<your_last_name>_deduper.py``` and place it in the top leve of your repo (that is, not inside a folder)
