DeDuper- Part 1 - Pseudocode – Reference Based PCR Duplicate Removal Tool
David Evarts 
Due 11/15/19

The Problem:  PCR amplification is used to provide enough fragments to capture most of the unique reads and create a library for sequencing.   RNAseq is often used to measure differential expression.  PCR duplicates can be mistaken for biological increases in expression and mask the true expression levels.  If the amount of PCR amplification is heightened, in order to capture elements that are rarely expressed, the amount of PCR duplication can increase substantially.

The Purpose: If duplicates that are not due to higher expression, but are, instead, artifacts of library creation, such as PCR amplification, can be removed, a better understanding of the expression levels of genetic elements can be achieved.

The general strategy:  When Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) have been added, a PCR duplicate fragment read will have all of the following features, when compared with a duplicated read.  These can be determined from the SAM file and a list of UMIs.  Parsing through the reads, duplicates will be isolated.

•	It will be on the same strand.
•	It will be on the same chromosome
•	It will be at the same initial position, after accounting for soft clipping at the beginning in the read direction.
•	It will have the same UMI.
Examples:
Properly formatted Input Sam file:  What does this look like?
Properly formated expected output sam file:

######Functions:#########

Def Direction_Checker(one Sam aligned read):  Unless find a samtool that provides a reverse file and a forward file

Def Forward_adjust_start (one Sam aligned read cigar string and one 0 based left most start position):
This function takes the cigar string from one forward read and its start position and returns an adjusted start position.
•	Grab start position number, set it as count
•	Grab cigar string by column number
•	Grep for first number letter combination
	- If letter is S, subtract the number preceding it from count.
Return - A number that is the adjusted start position.
Unit Test - Try the following cigar strings and start position.  Print the count. 
	start = 1, cigar = 10M, adusted = 1
	start = 2, cigar = 2S5M, adjusted = 0
	start = 37, cigar = 1S3M7N4M, adjusted = 36

Def Reverse_adjust_start (one Sam aligned reverse read):
This function takes the cigar string from one reverse read and its start position and returns an adjusted start position.
•	 Grab start position number, set it as count
•	Grab cigar string by column number
•	In a loop Grep for each number- letter combination
	- If letter is S preceeded by a letter and a number, add the number preceding it to count. 
          This is because you want to add soft-clips at the end of the number chain/ start of the read  on reverse reads, but 
	  not at the left-most position.
	- If letter is M, add the number preceding it to the count.
	- If letter is N add the number preceding it to the count.
	- If letter is D add the number preceding it to the count.
	- If letter is I ignore the number in front of it.
Return - A number that is the adjusted start position.
Unit Test - Try the following cigar strings and start position.  Print the count. 
	start = 50, cigar = 10M,20N,10M,5D,5S adusted = 100
	start = 0, cigar = 5M,10N,5M, adjusted = 20
	start = 0, cigar = 1S5M10N4M, adjusted = 20
	
########Pseudo-Code:###########
-Input is via a bash slurm script which collects the arg-parse arguments.

1.) #### Install arg-parse function ####
Return – ability to set arg-parse
Unit Test – See Arg parse function below. If Arg-Parse function works, it’s installed.

2.) #### Install conda environment####
Return – ability to read python script
Unit Test – Slurm shell should be able to read and respond to a python print(“foo”) script and will display bgmp -env3

3.) ###Use Arg-Parse function to collect information and set tags that can be called.###  
 - Collect Input SAM file. Specify that it must be a SAM file that has been ordered using SamTools -sort. 
 - SamTools sort outputs a sorted (by position) Bam file. 
 - If we use Bam to Sam to convert it to a human readable file, do we keep the sorting?
	-collect UMI file as a TSV
	-collect from user wether this is a single or paired-end read
	-collect from user whether duplicates should be recorded in a duplicates output file
	-collect from user name to use on output file
Return – A slurm script calling a correctly worded python script with arg flags in slurm script and arg parse coded in python script should correctly respond to the following print commands.
	-print name of sam file input test script.  tester_ordered.sam
	-print name of UMI.tsv
	-print single or paired end
	-print duplicates file name.sam or none
	-print correct file name.sam

4.) #### Open the input SAM file####
Open as read.
Return- opened file
Unit Test – display tester input sam file with cat command piped to head.

5.) ####Open an output duplicates_removed.sam File.####
Open with write permission
Return -opened, writable file.
Unit Test – write first full read from input tester file to output file.  Display contents with cat command.

######Big Loop#######
6.) ####Open1st and 2nd Read####
Initialize a list Good files.
For each line in the file, if begins with "@HD", "@  2nd and 3rd, do the same.
Open 3rd and 4th, do the same.
Continue with last in a pair and the next in line, until done.  How?

Loop to check pairs
###Determine Direction of Read####
Use orientation ()
If forward go to forward loop.
Else go to reverse loop.
